This package and its subpackages define a first incomplete version of the
Household Energy Management project simply meant to provide a starting point
showing what is expected after the step 1 in the project. The goal of this
first step is to program components representing the equipments for the
complete project. The idea is to see these components as if they were the
software embedded in actual equipments to make them digital. 
</p>
<p>
Subpackages contain BCM4Java components representing electrical equipments:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2025e3.equipments.batteries</code>:
  represents the component, interfaces, ports, connector as well as a unit
  test for the batteries.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2025e3.equipments.batteries</code>:
  represents the component, interfaces, ports, connector as well as a unit
  test for the generator.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2025e3.equipments.hairdryer</code>:
  represents the component, interfaces, ports, connector as well as a
  unit test for a hair dryer, an uncontrollable equipment in project
  terms.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2025e3.equipments.heater</code>: 
  represents the component, interfaces, ports, connector as well as a
  unit test for a thermostated heater, a suspensible equipment in project
  terms.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2025e3.equipments.hem</code>:
  represents a first draft for the household energy manager to be
  completed and which execution serves as integration test for the
  whole project at this step.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2025e3.equipments.meter</code>:
  represents a first draft for the electric meter to be completed later.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2025e3.equipments.batteries</code>:
  represents the component, interfaces, ports, connector as well as a unit
  test for the solar panel.</li>
</ul>
